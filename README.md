# Ice-Theme-Zen-Browser-
A new zen browser style theme, made to be similar to transluscent frosted glass and a rounded edge across browsers total design
This is my first project with the aim of improving how to zen browser looks, by making it more like frosted glass and simplyifying the rest of the menu and setting elements. I am new to this, so forgive the code and repair times on this.
