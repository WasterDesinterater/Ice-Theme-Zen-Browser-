# Ice-Theme-Zen-Browser-
A new zen browser style theme, made to be similar to transluscent frosted glass and possess a rounded edge across the browser's total design. I have been a fan of minimalizing the elements of the settings and design language of different applications, so this theme aims to do that across the zen browser suite. It is not finished as of yet, not even close, as well as the application menu possesses a html tag object which seems impossible to stylize, which is the reason for the weird black background and edges, but I wanted to put it out there and see how it goes. 
I must also mention lingais' super sleek ui, which inspired me to undertake this project.

I am new to this, so forgive the code inefficency and repair times on this.
